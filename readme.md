# Teamfight Tactics battle simulator

Teamfight Tactics is an auto chess game made by Riot.

To my knowledge this was the first battle simulator for TFT which fully mimics the game's internal battle logic. Every action is repeated just like in the game. When I got this done, I believe it to have been the only actual simulator out there. The game version is tied to 10.24b and thus the creation serves no purpose anymore.

Upkeeping the simulator would require constant work and patches. A few times a year when Riot releases major updates, I would have to create every new champion, ability and item from scratch. This is the reason why I didn't release the simulator to public.

Haven't done any testing since Riot's match data policies had some terms which might've been broken if used for this purpose, but in my personal use the simulator's results didn't deviate much. Meaning that the simulator is solid. The 'interface' -folder's readme has some running instructions.
